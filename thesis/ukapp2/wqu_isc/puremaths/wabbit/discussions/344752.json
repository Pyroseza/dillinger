If you need to transfer a file on Wabbitemu to the computer, you can go View-&gt;Variables and then select the program you'd like to export and either drag it off the tree, or select the export button.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your feedback. Let me know if you have any other questions, or features that would make it more helpful for you and your students.</p>\r\n<p>BuckeyeDude</p>",
