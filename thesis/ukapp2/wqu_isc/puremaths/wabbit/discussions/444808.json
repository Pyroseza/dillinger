I am going to give a very simple solution for this problem.<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Right click on the Wabbitemu</li>\n<li>Go to File</li>\n<li>Go to save...</li>\n<li>\nSave it as a .sav (save state) and make sure it is in the folder for the Wabbitemu.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis should keep the programs and applications placed in Wabbitemu in the emulator. Thank you for reading my post and I hope it helps you. May the force be with you.<br />\n",
