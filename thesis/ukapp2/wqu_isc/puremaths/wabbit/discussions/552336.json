Which version of ti-81 is supported? (when I choose this rom the emulator restarts and ask again for a rom)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",

    "Html": "Unfortunately, TI-30XS, 34 and College-Plus use a different CPU than the 83 series of calculators. Wabbit currently is only a Z80 emulator, so to support the calculators requires a lot of reverse engineering.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs for your issue with the TI-81v2 rom, all known versions of the TI-81 should work. I've tested with a 1.1, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0. Give the 1.04 update a shot and see if it fixes the issue.\r<br />\n<br />\nBuckeyeDude<br />\n",
