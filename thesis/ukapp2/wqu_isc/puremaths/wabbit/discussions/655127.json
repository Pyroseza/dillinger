Perhaps this is part of the underlying problem?? I then tried the same download on a Win10 machine (turns out there was also a captcha that did not appear on the S5... maybe it didn't get that far).  But, when I transferred the downloaded .8Xu file to the S5 and tried to compile it in the emulator, it still said &quot;error&quot; even though it found and recognized the .8Xu file.<br />\n....<br />\nso, I searched for a &quot;ti84 ROM&quot; image on the internet, transferred it, said &quot;have ROM&quot;, and everything works.  Thanks.<br />\n",
