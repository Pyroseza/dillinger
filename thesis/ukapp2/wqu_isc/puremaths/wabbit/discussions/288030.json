    "Html": "<p>Hello persalteas,</p>\r\n<p>Sorry about the issues with wabbit. The thing that is likely causing your issues are the settings in the registry. First open up Task manager and check and make sure that no instance of Wabbitemu.exe is running. If it is, end the process. Then goto the start menu. If you're on Vista or 7 you can simply type regedit. If you're on XP click the run dialog and then type regedit. This will open the registry editor. Wabbitemu's settings are in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wabbitemu. Select that folder then press delete.</p>\r\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions or other issues.</p>\r\n<p>BuckeyeDude</p>",
