Timendus seems to suggest that there's a bcall (_ipoint, _vputs, _dispop1a, and _setxxop1) touching one of the ports and messing with the silent linking. The strange thing is just that it runs fine on WabbitEmu but not on actual hardware.</p>\r\n",

Hopefully soon I'll be able to put out a newer version with improved linking support. For now however I would recommend always double checking on real hardware to ensure the linking is accurate.</p>",
