It appears to be easier and less expensive to connect a pc running emulation to the classroom projection system, than connecting other devices such as Androids, iPhones or calculators.<br />\n\r<br />\nTried placing a copy of the 32 bit wabbitemu software in a separate folder and running the setup again; failed to download the TI84plus SE rom.  Got nowhere.<br />\n",

Make sure you use the newest version I just put up, as I fixed the OS download from TI.  After you have a ROM, you can use File -&gt; New to get another type running.  You won't need a second copy of the program.<br />\n",
