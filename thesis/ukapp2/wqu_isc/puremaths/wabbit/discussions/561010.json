All I do is File | Open and select TI73.ROM, and I'm in business.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've installed Wabbitemu 1.02 on Android, and copied the TI73.ROM file to a folder (I've tried it on internal and external storage).  When Wabbitemu runs for the first time, I get the Getting Started welcome message and tell it I already have a ROM file.  It then scans and finds the ROM, and as soon as I click it, it takes me back to the start and shows me the Getting Started welcome message again.  I am caught in an infinite loop.<br />\n",
