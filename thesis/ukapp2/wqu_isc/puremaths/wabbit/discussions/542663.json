Try the beta from here: <a href=\"http://buckeyedude.com/Revsoft/Wabbitemu/Beta/Wabbitemu.exe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://buckeyedude.com/Revsoft/Wabbitemu/Beta/Wabbitemu.exe</a>. It has better skin handling code, and will darken your keypresses like normal.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf that still doesn't work, I'll take another look at it. The invalid skin size message usually indicate that the skin is not a factor of 350x725 px. Maybe you were loading a different version that didn't quite conform to those dimensions?\r<br />\n<br />\nBuckeyeDude<br />\n",
