When I start Wabbitemu and choose the &quot;I already have a ROM file&quot; it can't find the ROM (i saved it in the downloads directory on my phone).\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I choose &quot;Help me create a ROM...&quot; then TI85 isn't one of the options.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease advise. I actually have a TI85 and am fine with creating a ROM file on the phone rather than downloading one, but right now I can't do anything.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you! <br />\n",
