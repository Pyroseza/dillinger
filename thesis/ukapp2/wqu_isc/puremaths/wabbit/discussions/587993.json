(available only the button back)\r<br />\n5.- finally, to activate the &quot;Teacher mode&quot; immediately enter a 4 digit passcode to exit the application. (key that would assign the teacher to exit the application with button back).\r<br />\n<br />\nThese features allow many teachers use your program and not just chile, also the rest of the world.\r<br />\nThat would be unique.\r<br />\n<br />\nGreetings.<br />\n",
