Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>My question: I'm using a tablet PC (Lenovo X201 Tablet). I can use wabbitemu with the trackpad, but it does not respond when I try to use it with the tablet's pen. I can't see any reason why it wouldn't, but I've also checked my configurations and can't\r\n find anything that looks like it would be a problem. Any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the help.</p>\r\n",
