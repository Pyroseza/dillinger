The problem is that the interperted BASIC code is pretty convoluted. If your intention is to actually disassemble the OS then I reccomend getting a separate disassembly program.</p>\r\n<p>As for&nbsp;fixing your BASIC program I don't know of any BASIC debuggers, but if you post your code here I might be able to help you.</p>\r\n<p>BuckeyeDude&nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hello again,</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately the reason you can't modify the ROM of the 82 stats is because the memory isn't flash memory, its ROM (Read only memory).&nbsp; This means theres no such thing as 'Archive', you have to store everything in RAM. If all you need to do is modify the memory in the emulator then you can simply open the debugger and use the memory view at the bottom to edit byte by byte, but this is no good for doing something like writing a&nbsp;program.</p>\r\n<p>BuckeyeDude</p>",

These routines are the bare minimum to write to flash on the 83+ and 84+ series. It may be slightly different for the chip in the 82 stats.fr so I reccomend googling the data sheet for the flash chip. They're usually provided by the manufacturer and will explain exactly how to write to flash.</p>",
