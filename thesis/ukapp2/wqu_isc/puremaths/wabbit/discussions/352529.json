Does this mean that the dll is outdated and that it can't be used with the latest version of wabbitemu ? Is the wiki documentation\r\n about the COM interface outdated ? Thanks for answers.",

    "Html": "<p>The DLL contains the same code as the EXE only provided as a link library. This means you can use it without the EXE. It also means the code is slightly out of date, but since most of the changes have been to the GUI, there is no reason to release a new DLL. The wiki is probably a little out of date, but the basics are all there. The sample project should contain plenty to get you started.</p>",
