To rember windows position I have to start the Wabbitemu.exe of&nbsp;april2011, to set the mark in the&nbsp;\"Remember windows position\", close Wabbitemu, start the Wabbitemu version november 2011 and now it remembers its position. <br />But after a change of skin this setting is again lost! And then I have to follow the same procedure.</p>\n<p>Second: the option Always on Top is apparently not stored. I have to mark it again and again.</p>\n<p>Hope this can be repaired since this program is highly useful!</p>",
