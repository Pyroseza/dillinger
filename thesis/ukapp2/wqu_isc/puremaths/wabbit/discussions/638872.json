When I click on the application, the window shoots off in a direction that I can't see. I see it flash to the right side of my screen and then I can't see it. \r<br />\n<br />\nI don't know how to uninstall it. And I've tried re-downloading the .exe files, and it doesn't help.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnd I'm not very tech-savvy, so any simple explanations would really help. <br />\n",
