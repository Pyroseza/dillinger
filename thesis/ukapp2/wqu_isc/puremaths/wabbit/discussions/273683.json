I've uploaded a new version that you'll want to download and try, it will fix the issue with closing wabbitemu (I'm guessing you are in skin cutout mode). As for not being able to click the buttons, I didn't see any issue with that, tell me if the latest download fixes it. Also when you right click, make sure it is on the screen not anywhere else on the skin.</p>",
