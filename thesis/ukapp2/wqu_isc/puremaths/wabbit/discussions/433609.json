When I opened the program again, much to my displeasure, they were gone and none of the settings I'd selected, like the autosave feature, were still selected.  How do I get the emulator to actually save things and respond to the built in autosave commands?  I would love to save some programs I have written to the emulator and it is frustrating to have to rewrite them each time I open it.  Any ideas?<br />\n",
