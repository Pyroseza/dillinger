The Emulator window however has become fuzzy (anti-aliased fonts?), at any rate not as crisp as it used to be.\r<br />\nThe windowed skin mode appears to be scalabe, which is nice for larger zoom factors if you need this. But the down side is that smaller zoom factors look ugly.\r<br />\nIn windowed skin mode, I tried to find the best image quality - zoom factor 1.00 (?) - but when I then switched to cutout skin mode, I got the impression that the zoom factor was nudged down a bit, again resulting in an ugly image.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Sorry for the delay in reply. There were a couple of issues here. One, to accommodate scaling, the skins sizes were doubled. This meant that all the skins scaled down by half for regular drawing. For the most part it looked fine for normal skins, with a little more blurriness for certain skewed texts on the 84 series. However for cutout mode, I couldn't use the same interpolation mode as on the normal skin, and it didn't end up looking as good. To fix cutout mode required a rewrite of a good chunk of drawing code (which I have done now). To fix blurry fonts on the 84 series required me to re-render a good chunk of the skin. In the process I redid parts of it to make it more accurate to the real thing.\r<br />\n<br />\nHere's an album comparing the rendering of 1.7.2.11 to my latest builds: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/Ag8IS\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/a/Ag8IS</a>\r<br />\nIf you'd like to test the latest version for yourself, I've uploaded it to: <a href=\"http://buckeyedude.com/Revsoft/Wabbitemu/Beta/Wabbitemu.exe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://buckeyedude.com/Revsoft/Wabbitemu/Beta/Wabbitemu.exe</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nTL;DR: known issue, will be fixed soon.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nBuckeyeDude<br />\n",
