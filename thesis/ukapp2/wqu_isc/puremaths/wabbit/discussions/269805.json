You'll want to download app.inc from <a href=\"http://wabbit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=SPASM%20Include%20Files&amp;referringTitle=Documentation\">http://wabbit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=SPASM%20Include%20Files&amp;referringTitle=Documentation</a>, and just follow the instructions on how to set up your code.&nbsp;When you assemble it, simply make&nbsp;sure your output file has the .8xk eg: spasm input.asm output.8xk&nbsp;</p>",
