I have WabbitEmu installed on an LGK10 running Android 6.0.1 Software version K42810f.  Also I've installed WabbitEmu on a friend's Android device, a tablet that's a few years old.  Not sure of the OS on that one as I don't have it with me right now.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyone else experience problems running TI Connect with WabbitEmu installed on Android Devices?  Any suggestions?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks -- Joni\r<br />\nI<br />\n",
