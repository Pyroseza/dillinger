    "Html": "Whatever version of wabbitemu that I have has very limited functionality. There is no &quot;Calculator&quot; menu like I'm seeing in Youtube Videos. Similarly, the &quot;View&quot; menu only has three options, which are &quot;Skin Mode&quot;, &quot;Show Toolbar&quot;, and &quot;Customize Toolbar&quot;. Which is odd, because I've never even seen a toolbar on this thing. Did I download an old version, or is the Mac just have fewer functions than the Windows one? When I first started it, it wouldn't even let me load a ROM because the menu option to do so was grayed out. In desperation, I just dragged the ROM image onto the window and that got me into skin mode, but this program is useless to me if I can't load or export programs and variables.<br />\n",
