    "Html": "Hi Knelli,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm guessing you used the old version of the SciTools apps, intended for non color editions. These are not compatible with the color version, however there is a bug with Wabbitemu that allows you to load them anyway. The fix is easy:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Download the correct version here: <a href=\"http://education.ti.com/en/us/software/details/en/9D3F4BCE82714C8591DD2F808CFCACDE/84c-science-tools-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://education.ti.com/en/us/software/details/en/9D3F4BCE82714C8591DD2F808CFCACDE/84c-science-tools-app</a></li>\n<li>Open wabbitemu</li>\n<li>If you're still stuck on the blank screen, you can do a Debug-&gt;Reset Calculator</li>\n<li>\nLoad the latest version you downloaded<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThis should allow you to use SciTools, just like you do on the normal calc.\r<br />\n<br />\nLet me know if you have anymore questions or issues,\r<br />\nBuckeyeDude<br />\n",
