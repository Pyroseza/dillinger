    "Html": "I have been using this emulator for the past couple of months for my technical math class which focuses on the use of the TI-84.  The problem is today after doing some organizing and moving the emulator to a folder along with it's .rom and my .sav files it suddenly stopped working.  When I went to open the emulator it blew up to a large size(Much larger than it was before) and no longer reconized key clicks.  I tried deleting it and reinstalling it, but that didn't seem to work at all.  I saw in another post to try resizing it and turning it on with debug mode, but this didn't work either.  I just get a blank screen with what looks like a faded grid on it and nothing else.  Also when I click to go into 'cut out' skin the entire emulator disappears and I get some sort of weird black backwards L shape.  Please help as I have a midterm on Monday and I need this calculator to work.<br />\n",

You can do so by:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Pressing WinKey+R</li>\n<li>\nEntering the following command:\r<br />\nregedit /e &quot;%UserProfile%\\Wabbitemu.reg&quot; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wabbitemu\r<br />\nThis will export Wabbitemu.reg to your user directory (eg C:\\Users[username]\\Wabbitemu.reg). Can you upload this file somewhere so I can look at it.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThanks,\r<br />\nBuckeyeDude<br />\n",
