    "Html": "Hi SFer,\r<br />\n<br />\nGlad to hear you like the software. Thanks for your feedback about the new Android app, were still working to resolve all the issues. Can you screenshot the problem you're having with the skin? I think I know what it is, but getting a visual will tell me for sure. You can take a screenshot by holding down the volume button and power button at the same time for a couple seconds.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks again,\r<br />\nBuckeyeDude<br />\n",
