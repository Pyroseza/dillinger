TI has made it illegal to distribute&nbsp;this code, which prevents us from putting&nbsp;it directly in Wabbitemu.&nbsp;If you have access to a windows machine, the windows version has a wizard to help you through the process. The Mac version unfortunately does not have this and you'll have to dump the boot page manually from the calculator.
