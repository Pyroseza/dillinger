    "Html": "Unfortunately there is not. The size of the ROM is pretty deeply tied to the hardware of the calc. Adding more memory is very easily with the emulator but accessing the memory requires serious modification of the OS.\r<br />\nDid you use Wabbitemu to create an open source ROM version? I'm not sure how much of the hardware of the AlmostTI emulates, I haven't done much testing with it, its possible it doesn't emulate something required by the ROM. Very soon I'll be releasing a new version of Wabbitemu for Android that you might be interested.\r<br />\n<br />\nLet me know if there is anything that I can help with.\r<br />\n<br />\nBuckeyeDude<br />\n",
