Today when I tried downloading and installing Wabbitemu from scratch on Windows 7 Home Edition 32 bits, I received the following error message when trying to install the ROM from open source: &quot;Unable to download file&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nI have never encountered this error message before. Any ideas what it might be or how to resolve it? I have an active functional internet connection and have installed all major Windows updates.<br />\n<br />\nPlease help!<br />\nThanks,<br />\nChris<br />\n",

I downloaded the os manually: ttps://education.ti.com/en/us/software/details/en/B7DADA7FD4AA40CE9D7911B004B8C460/ti84plusoperatingsystem (select &quot;continue as guest&quot; when asked to login). Now when running setup wizard you select &quot;browse for os files on my computer&quot; and select the downloaded file. This resolved the problem in my case...\r<br />\nAnna<br />\n",
