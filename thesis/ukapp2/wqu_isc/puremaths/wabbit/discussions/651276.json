By that, I mean that when I relaunch my calculator, it clears the calc's RAM and none of my calculations are saved. This even happens if I keep the calculator in my recent apps. I've been using this calculator for more than a year and it never used to do this.<br />\nThis started with the software update before last, I believe (currently T V1.05.12). \r<br />\n<br />\nDoes anyone have any clue as to what is going on or what can be done? I don't see anything in settings that would affect this.<br />\n",
