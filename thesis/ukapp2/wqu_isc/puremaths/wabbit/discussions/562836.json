    "Html": "Hello! I am trying to run multiple emulators at the same time without having to re-run the setup wizard for each emulator. Is this feasible? I've tried placing the emulators in separate folders, renaming the .exe's, even placing them on different drives but it always seems to revert. I would like this feature because I am a math teacher with students who have 83+'s, 84+'s and 84C's, just to be able to illustrate the nuances of each calculator. I LOVE this emulator - it is very CLEAR for the students to be able to see what is going on! THANK YOU!!!<br />\n",
