So I loaded the correct rom, the ti 83 plus rom, and tried loading one of the games, it was in 8xp format. But I don't know how to get to it now. It doesn't automatically load the game. How do I play it? I tried going into the apps on the calculator emulator and all it shows is finance. Please help! <br />\n",
