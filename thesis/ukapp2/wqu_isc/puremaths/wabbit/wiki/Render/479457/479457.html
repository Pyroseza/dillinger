<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The #comment preprocessor allows for block comments in your source files. Very similar to a C style /* */ comment, when encountered these instruct the assembler to ignore all other text until the preprocessor #endcomment. This is very handy when you have
 long blocks of text that you want to format without worrying about using large numbers of semicolons.</p>
