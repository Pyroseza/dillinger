    "Description": "I am trying to install the March 25 version on an older PC running Windows 7 Pro.  The PC has 2GB of PC3200 RAM, an Anthlon XP 3200+ CPU, and an nVidia FX5500 AGP card.  Are there hardware minimum requirements for the install?  I keep getting \"Wabbitemu Z80 Emulator has stopped working\" and problem details show \"Appcrash\".  Any advice would be appreciated.",

When I click on finish I am asked to save the file. I chose the file name given and it goes back to the OS Selection window and then I get a \"program not responding\" message. I have Windows 8.2 and 8.00 GB of RAM with an Intel Core i5 Processor. It should work.",
