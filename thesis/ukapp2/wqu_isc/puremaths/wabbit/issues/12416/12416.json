When I use wabbitemu to calculate the mean and standard deviation for a probability distribution and use 1-Var Stats, List, I enter L1, then try to enter a comma, then L2, but the software doesn't let me enter the comma.  Thus I can't enter L1, L2.\nI watched a YouTube video and these were the instructions for calculating the mean and standard deviation for a probability distribution.",
