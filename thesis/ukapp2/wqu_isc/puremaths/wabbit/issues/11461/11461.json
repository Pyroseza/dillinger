    "Description": "Saw the comment about the TI83+; same deal with the TI84+. Looking forward to being able to resize. \n\nAlso, it took me an hour of clicking before I realized you have to right-click inside the LCD window to bring up the menu - I kept clicking in non-button areas of the skin. Perhaps you could make it so that right-clicking in non-button areas of the skin could bring up the menu?\n\nThanks!",
