    "Description": "I was trying to work a bit on my Z80 skills as i encountered a weird thing. For a few months i was happy to get stuff working with Wabbitcode. So i just loaded my code again, did assemble it and wanted to run it with Wabbitmenu z80+ emulator.\n\nAssembling went well, but the emulator just says: ERR:SYNTAX\n\nEven a simple program like this does not work anymore. All is well during assembly. It gives the same error on a real device by the way.\n\nDo i miss anything? I have no clue where to look/start.\n\n```\n.nolist\n#include \"../ti84plus.inc\"\n#define    ProgStart    $9D95\n.list\n.org    ProgStart - 2\n\t.db    t2ByteTok, tAsmCmp\n\tbcall(_ClrLCDFull)\n    \n\tld a, 12\n\tbcall(_PutC); \n\n\trlca\n\tbcall(_PutC); \n\n\tRET\n    \n.end\n.end\n```",
