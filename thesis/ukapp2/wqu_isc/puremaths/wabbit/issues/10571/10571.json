    "Description": "I downloaded WabbitEmu 2.1 on my Mac OSX 10.8.2.\n\nWhen I start WabbitEmu, I choose File -> Open and choose my ROM (ti82, ti83, etc).\n\nAfter that, if I click with my mouse on the calculators buttons, the mapping is all weird. On my TI82, when I click on Graph, it input log(...\n\nMany buttons simply do not produce anything. My roms are good because they work fine in Tilem in Linux.\n\nDo you have any idea?",

      "Message": "i had the same issue. are you using the retina display macbook? if so, its the high dpi resolutions/retina resolution mode that i guess wabbitemu does not support. i use an app called quickres to switch to the standard res mode like on a regular macbook and it now works perfectly at 1920x1200 standard resolution.

      "Message": "Maybe this can solve the problem but I think it would be better to fix wabbit to work with Retina display. I don't think that in the long term, always changing the screen resolution to go back to non-retina is the solution.\r\n\r\nBut thank you for the fix for now!",
