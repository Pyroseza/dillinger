    "Description": "I updated Windows 7 last night (not sure if this is related) when I installed Wabbitemu the emulator shows up and but there is a large window overlapping the calculator.  The buttons do not match up with the image on the screen making the emulator unusable.  I attached an image of what it looks like.",
