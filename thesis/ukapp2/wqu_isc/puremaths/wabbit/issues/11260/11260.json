    "Description": "Hi,\nI noticed that the latest version of WabbitEMU is consuming a lot of CPU-power.\nNot immediately, but definitely after a few minutes, CPU-usage of WabbitEMU jumps up to the range of 50%.\nIs anyone else experiencing this as well?\n\nWhat can I do to provide more information concerning this issue?\n* Log-files, which, how?\n* Settings, which, how?\n\nMy system:\n* W8 Professional\n* TI-84 ROM v2.55\n\nCheers,\nStephan",

      "Message": "I've done some quick tests and haven't been able to reproduce the issue, so I'll need to narrow it down. I don't have a 32-bit machine, so I can't test on one but I'm curious if you are using the 32 bit or 64 bit version of Wabbit on your 64 bit machine. If you are using the 64 bit version can you try the 32 and see if you can reproduce the issue that way?\nAlso, is there anything specific you need to do to create the issue. For example if you close all instances of Wabbit, then reopen a new one and let it sit does the CPU just jump up after a few minutes? If I had to guess, I would say that the root cause is related to keypresses. When using Wabbit do you normally press the keys or click on the skin? Let me know if you can reproduce the issue without doing anything, and if not, what are the simplest steps you can go through to recreate it.\nAnother thing to check would be to turn off the cutout mode (the borderless window). It is known to use more CPU on lower end systems and may be exacerbating the issue. Try seeing if you can recreate the issue without it.\r\n\r\nThanks for the report,\nBuckeyeDude",
