    "Description": "1. When I save ROMs as `.rom` or `.bin` Wabbitemu does not show me a dialog for author, comments, compression and read-only. I think this is related to 2.\n2. When I save a file as  `.rom` or `.bin`  and open it later it shows me \"RAM cleaned\". But not only my RAM was cleaned, but also some apps saved in the archive were deleted.\nIn contrast: When I save it as `.sav` and open it later it shows exactly the state where I left off.",
