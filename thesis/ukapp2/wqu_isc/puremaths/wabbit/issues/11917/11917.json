    "Description": "Does anyone have a solution to the TI Emulators? The Mac version downloads fine and opening is alright. When I open the .zip file, I'm prompted by a notification that asks me if I want to open it. I click yes and then it creates the WabbitEmu calculator app and then when I double click on the app, it doesn't open. It shows up on my dock but it's constantly blank. I can inspect the contents and all that but it's just not showing up on my screen. If any of you guys know how to troubleshoot and fix this, I would really appreciate that. Thank you!",
