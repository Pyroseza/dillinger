    "Description": "Hi, a week ago I downloaded the wabbitemu software and I have to say it is very well done. I'd had a pleasant experience until yesterday, when screenshots started saving in a low resolution format. I'm not sure what went wrong, I'd been using the screenshots option and had no problems at all, full 192x128 pictures, now I'm getting a resolution of 96x64. I haven't been able to find a way around this, is there anything I can do to fix it? I'm using the latest version of the software and the TI 84 Plus SE rom.",
