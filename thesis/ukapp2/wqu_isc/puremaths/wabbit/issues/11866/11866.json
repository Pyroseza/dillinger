    "Description": "I've have used wabbitemu for a while now and just downloaded the emulator onto my laptop. I have a habit of putting the task bar on top, but Wabbitemu seems to not play well with that. When I launch the application, the title bar seems to be overlapped by the task bar, as shown [here](http://puu.sh/bD7iQ/648365886e.jpg). Is there anyway to change the position of where the application launches? It seems to re-position where it launches every time I open it.",
