    "Description": "Hi,\n\nLong time Wabbitemu user here. Today when I tried downloading and installing Wabbitemu from scratch on Windows 7 Home Edition 32 bits, I received the following error message when trying to install the ROM from open source: \"Unable to download file\".\n\nI have never encountered this error message before. Any ideas what it might be or how to resolve it? I have an active functional internet connection and have installed all major Windows updates.\n\nPlease help!\nThanks,\nChris",
