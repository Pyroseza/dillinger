    "Description": "Hi, I am not as technical as many of you.  I am a mother trying to help my daughter be prepared for algebra I.  I built an older laptop for her (AMD Athlon 800MHz processor with 600 MB ram, pitiful I know) and have installed XP Professional and updated as far as possible with SP 3.  Whenever I try to install the Wabbitemu.exe I get an error \"Wabbitemu Z80 Emulator has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.\"  I tried reading the technical report which I sent to Microsoft, but it made no sense to me.  The installation process worked fine on my win7 machine, but I want her to be able to use the calculator at her own convenience.  It seems that all of the software/hardware on her machine is running correctly.  Can anyone help?",
