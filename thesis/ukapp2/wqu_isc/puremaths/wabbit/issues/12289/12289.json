    "Description": "It would be nice if you could easily export files (aka (App)Variables/Apps/...) stored on your device to your computer.\nCurrently you can perfectly drag and drop a file into the calculator, but AFAIK you have no way to get a specific variable or other thing exported.\nYou can obviously just save the whole ROM (as a `.sav`), but not single pieces of data.",
