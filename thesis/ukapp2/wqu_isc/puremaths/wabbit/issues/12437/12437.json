    "Description": "Every time I try to download a calculator on my laptop I keep on getting \"OS file is corrupt or invalid.\" The steps that I do are to first download Wabbitemu and then I go through the setup which included: 1) create a ROM image using open source software, 2) I pick the calculator (I tried all of them), 3) I click download OS files from TI's website (tried both versions of files), 4) gave the file a name and then 5) clicked finish.",

Wabbit has a glitch where it does not properly download the OS file from the TI website and you can circumvent that by downloading it directly. Read the Imgur album.",
