    "Description": "I have downloaded this on my PC at school, but am trying to get it for my MAC at home. When I click on the one under downloads for MAC it downloads perfectly fine but when you actually open the program nothing comes up. It shows up on my tool bar but it shows no calculator and there isn't even an option for which version of the calculator you want to use. Am I downloading it wrong? Is there a step by step process to downloading this on the  mac?",
