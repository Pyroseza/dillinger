    "Description": "I have been using the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition wabbitemu. I was trying to return the columns under the STAT feature back to default, and decided to Reset Calculator under the Debug menu. Now the emulator has a severe lag in all functions. I tried raising the speed of the emulator, and I've deleted and re-downloaded wabbitemu a few times now. I have yet to find a solution. I am hoping someone will help. I am using the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 with Windows 8.1.",
