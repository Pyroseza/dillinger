I have to click above the bottons to have them register. \n\nNo issues when not in cutout mode. Bug?",

Unfortunately, the behavior hasn't changed.\nOn startup, everything is fine, but after two seconds, the skin drops exactly 20 pixels.\r\n\r\nThe close and minimize button remain the same, screen stays stationary, and the place to click a button also stays the same.\nBut since the skin is now dropped 20 pix, you have to click above the buttons to activate them.\r\n\r\n![Image](http://i39.tinypic.com/2m78aro.jpg)",

      "Message": "Interesting. Since it is exactly 20 pixels, that tells me its related to the menu bar (which isn't show in cutout mode), but appears to be affect the sizing. I've uploaded another version of Wabbit with some changes that might fix this, try downloading it again from the same link.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, I'd like to understand why I can't reproduce this issue. If you could, I'd like to export your Wabbitemu settings. You can do so by:\n1. Pressing WinKey+R\n2. Entering the following command:\n```\nregedit /e \"%UserProfile%\\Wabbitemu.reg\" HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wabbitemu\n```\nThis will export Wabbitemu.reg to your user directory (eg C:\\Users\\\\[username]\\Wabbitemu.reg). Can you upload this file so I can look at your settings? I'd also like to know any settings in Windows you're using that may affect the menu bar. This means settings such as theme, language options, accessibility settings, etc, ways you may have customized Windows that would effect Wabbitemu. In the mean time I'll continue to test and look for ways to cause and fix this.",
