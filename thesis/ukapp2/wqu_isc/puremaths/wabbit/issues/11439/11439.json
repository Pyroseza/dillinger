    "Description": "Can someone help me out with saving state in OSx (Mavericks)? No matter what options I select or deselect I cannot get it to open the last state or save it at all. I know this used to work with older versions, but it seems the option is not even there now. Any help would be great!\n\n-Patt3r",
