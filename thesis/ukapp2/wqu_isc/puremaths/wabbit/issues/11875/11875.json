    "Description": "Hey,\n\nI like the emulator and all but after a few minutes it seems to crash. The screen of the Ti84 just goes blank and i can't do anything. If i restart the program everything is fine again untill another 5 minutes or so pass and everything crashes again. I really like the idea but an emulator that u can only use for a few minutes isn't really useful. Does anyone have any idea how i canfix this?\n\nThanks!",
