    "Description": "Hi I am using the latest version of Wabbitemu in Windows 7, 32-bit, Home Premium Edition, and I notice a considerable amount of lag when I type in numbers into the calculator. For example, I try to type the number 193500, but all that shows up in the calculator is \"5\". Is there a way to resolve this issue?\n\nUPDATE - This issue is resolved in the latest version released March 25, 2015. Thank you so much wabbitemu team!! :D",
