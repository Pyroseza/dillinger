For example: for teachers : you want to teach the basis of algorithmic to your student (yes, that's what is learn in France).\r\n\r\nYou can show it on a white wall using something I can't remember the name.\r\n\r\nSo the students look at a big screen and do exactly what the teacher does, so they can learn fast.\r\n\r\nRegards.",
