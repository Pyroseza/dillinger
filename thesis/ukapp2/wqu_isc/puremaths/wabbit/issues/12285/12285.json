    "Description": "It would be nice if Wabbitemu could sync the time of the host OS and the emulated calculator. (respectively at least in one direction: OS -> emulator)\nThis way you would always have the right time on your calc, which I think is a right thing.\n\nHowever you may of course make it configurable.",
