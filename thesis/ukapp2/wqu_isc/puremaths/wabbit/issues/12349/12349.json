    "Description": "Love the application first off. However, the application has been crashing on mobile devices and the only way to fix the problem has been in installing the program and then reinstalling it. I don't know ifor that is a problem with compatability issues with new software on mobile devices but it is very annoying to reinstall the program every time I need to use it.",
